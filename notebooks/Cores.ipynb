      "* In January 2015, I spent the longest, queasiest week of my life on a cruise ship filled with conspiracy theorists.\n",
      "* As our boat rattled toward Mexico and back, I heard about every wild plot, secret plan and dark cover-up imaginable.\n",
      "* It was mostly fascinating, occasionally exasperating and the cause of a headache that took months to fade.\n",
      "* To my pleasant surprise, given that I was a reporter travelling among a group of deeply suspicious people, I was accused of working for the CIA only once.\n",
      "* The unshakeable certainty possessed by many of the conspiracy theorists sometimes made me want to tear my hair out, how tightly they clung to the strangest and most far-fetched ideas.\n",
      "* I was pretty sure they had lost their hold on reality as a result of being permanently and immovably on the fringes of American life.\n",
      "* I felt bad for them and, to be honest, a little superior.\n",
      "* “The things that everyone thinks are crazy now, the mainstream will pick up on them,” proclaimed Sean David Morton early in the trip.\n",
      "* “Twenty sixteen is going to be one of those pivotal years, not just in human history, but in American history as well.”\n",
      "* Morton is a self-proclaimed psychic and UFO expert, and someone who has made a lot of dubious claims about how to beat government agencies such as the IRS in court.\n",
      "* (In 2017, he was sentenced to six years in prison for tax fraud.)\n"

      "* Trump’s fondness for conspiracy continued apace into his presidency: his Twitter account became a megaphone for every dark suspicion he has about the biased media and the rigged government working against him.\n",

      "* Man könnte das alles als Marotte abtun, wenn es nicht faktische Folgen hat: ich nenne nur die Gefahren satter Selbstzufriedenheit, die kategorische Unterschutzstellung verfassungsrechtlicher Errungenschaften mit der Folge einer zunehmenden Sklerosierung und Moralisierung der politischen Debatte.\n",
      "* Wenn aber derart die wirkliche politische Debatte verkümmert oder schon gar nicht mehr stattfindet, dann verwundert es schon weniger, wenn die Unterhaltungsindustrie Ersatzangebote für das demokratische Engagement in Form des beliebigen Mitredens und Abstimmens bereitstellt: Man spielt Demokratie, während sie uns gleichzeitig aus den Händen entgleitet.\n",
      "* Im Ergebnis können sich die Menschen seither nur noch für sich selbst, nicht aber mehr als politische Gemeinschaft an Gott oder einer vorgegebenen Wahrheit orientieren.\n",
      "* Dieser Befund hat aber auch sein Gutes: Wenn alle wissen, dass nicht nur wir selbst, sondern alle anderen die Wahrheit nicht kennen, dann empfiehlt es sich, dem anderen auch zuhören, dann wird es interessant, was und warum er etwas anderes sagt und denkt als man selbst, kurz: man kann im und durch Gespräch und Diskussionen „lernen“ und gute Lösungen für allfällige Probleme finden.\n",
      "* Wenn in dieser Debatte nicht mehr jede ernsthafte Meinung anderer unvoreingenommen zur Kenntnis genommen wird, man sich nicht mehr ergebnisoffen auseinandersetzt, sondern abweichende Meinungen moralisch diskreditiert oder in Form der political correctness zum Schweigen bringt, dann gerät die Demokratie ernsthaft in Gefahr: dann erhebt wiederum ein neuer Wahrheitsanspruch  im Gewand moralischer Überlegenheit einen Herrschaftsanspruch.\n",
      "* Maßstab für eine lebendige Demokratie ist also nicht eine „Wünsch-Dir-Was-Demokratie“, sondern eine, die sich selbst immer wieder kritisch die politischen Grundfragen an sich selbst stellt, um sich in der Zeit erfolgreich zu behaupten.\n",
      "* Mir scheint, dass wir auch heute wieder mehr authentischen Persönlichkeiten in und außerhalb des Parlaments brauchen, die zuhören wollen, nachdenken können, und die die „ehrliche Meinung Andersdenkender“ (Konrad Adenauer) nicht vorschnell abtun, nicht moralisch diskreditieren oder in die Fallgruben der politicall correctness laufen lassen, sondern sie zum Gegenstand eigenen Nachdenkens, des Verstehens machen und sich dann eine eigene Meinung bilden und diese wiederum in die Debatte einführen.\n",
      "* Gerade heute, wo große Teile der Bevölkerung der öffentlichen Diskussion misstrauen, erscheint mir diese für den Zusammenhalt des Gemeinwesens so zentrale Integration aller Meinungen, das agree to disagree, dringend und notwendiger zu sein denn je.\n"
